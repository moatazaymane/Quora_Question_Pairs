# Intro:

## Quora

On the question-and-answer website Quora, users can post questions and get answers from other users, either factually or as opinions. Adam D'Angelo and Charlie Cheever, two former employees of Facebook, co-founded Quora in June 2009. On June 21, 2010, the public initially had access to the website. The website is now accessible in many different languages.

It's hardly surprising that many questions on Quora are similar in wording given that over 100 million people visit the site each month. Multiple inquiries with the same objective can make readers feel as though they must respond to various variations of the same inquiry, while also making seekers spend more time looking for the best solution to their problem.
